*** javaScript Provides 8 different Data types:
    1 -> undefined
    2 -> null
    3 -> boolean
    4 -> string
    5 -> symbol
    6 -> bigint
    7 -> number
    8 -> object

*** when js variables are declared they have an initial value of undefined
*** mathematical operation with undefined varible will result NaN.

*** var , let and const keywords are  used to decalre variables
*** difference between var and let is :
    -> we can replace the data of a variable that is declared using var 
    -> if you try to replace the data of a variable declared using let it will show error

*** const keyword has all the features that let have . but variables declared with const keywords are read only..

*** Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). 
*** Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
